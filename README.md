## ros-things
Assorted ros things, not neccesarily in a coherent or cohesive form

#### Drone Ros Driver
I also have a forked version of the drone driver (from the AutonomyLab) 
I made one notable chang in their files: the cmd_vel topic was remapped to ardrone/cmd_vel.  I have been using multiple robots, each with their own cmd_vel topic

#### WPA config
The wpa setup files were forked from daraosn
